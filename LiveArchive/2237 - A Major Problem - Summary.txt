There are 12 notes used in musical notation, each identified by a capital letter between A and G, inclusive, and possibly an extra '#' or 'b', listed as follows:
	01. C/B#
	02. C#/Db
	03. D
	04. D#/Eb
	05. E/Fb
	06. F/E#
	07. F#/Gb
	08. G
	09. G#/Ab
	10. A
	11. A#/Bb
	12. B/Cb
These notes are cyclic, e.g.: C/B# comes again after B/Cb.
Notes which are on the same line and are separated by a slash are different notations for the same note.

The distance between two adjacent notes is called a semitone. The distance between two notes separated by exactly one other note is called a tone.

A major scale is a series of 8 notes, that can be generated by starting at any note and "jumping" over notes according to the pattern:
	tone-tone-semitone-tone-tone-tone-semitone.
A major scale also conforms to the following conditions:
	1. Each capital letter between A and G, inclusive, appears exactly once, counting those paired with '#' or 'b', except the letter of the first note of the scale,
	   which is repeated in the last position of the scale.
	2. '#' and 'b' may not be mixed in a single scale.
The first note of a scale is called the key of the scale.

In each test case, you are given two scale keys and, for each subsequent note provided:
	Let p be the position of the note in the first key's major scale, output the note in position p in the second key's major scale,
	or state that the input is invalid, following the output specifications mentioned in the problem statement.
